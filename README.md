# BEST Messina website

This is the repository for the BEST Messina website. It is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## How to make a suggestion for the website

Please feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/samupino/bestmessina-website/issues)! This will let us keep track of the requests and suggestions, and let you know when it is implemented.

## What is a repository

A repository is a folder containing files. This folder is hosted on GitHub (it's like a Google Drive, but mainly used for code). You can do the following things with a repository:

- Open and read the files it contains.
- Modify the files.
- Clone the repository, that means to download a copy of the entire folder on your computer. This will let you make modifications in your computer and then upload (we commonly say "push") them here on GitHub so that everybody can see them.

## How to contribute

Please read the [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started with the website development.
