The BEST Messina University Association announces that registrations are open for the BEST Courses for the spring season 2023, which will be held in the period between March and June.

BEST — Board of European Students of Technology — is a non-profit and apolitical organization that connects students from 90 technical universities (including the University of Messina) in 32 European countries.

BEST strives to help science-technology faculty students acquire an international mindset, gaining a better understanding of European cultures and developing the ability to work in an international context.

The BEST Courses, the heart of the association’s activities, are academic courses in English lasting one / two weeks that address highly topical scientific and technological issues. Lessons are held by the teaching staff of the host university or by business experts.

The student who participates in a BEST course will have the opportunity to experience a more practical approach to the topics of study, thanks to the visit of companies of international prestige and the acquisition of horizontal skills in technology, economics and management, as well as having recognized university formative credits (CFU).

In addition, participants from associated universities have the opportunity to expand their cultural background by living an international experience, establish contacts with other students from all over Europe, and improve the English language, which is now an indispensable requirement for introduction into the job market.

All these activities are almost free, in fact the lessons, board and lodging, social activities are largely financed by corporate sponsorships and donations from universities.

The same has happened for years in Messina, where thanks also to the support of the University and the ERSU Messina, which provides the Papardo University Residence and the canteens, guest students can take advantage of excellent services, among the best in Europe, according to the students themselves.

All students enrolled in courses and doctorates of the scientific-technological departments can participate in the BEST Courses.

The deadline for applying to participate in the spring courses is set for 27 November.

Ten European cities will host a BEST Course next spring, including Paris, Athens, Brussels, Grenoble, Lyon, Morstar, Turin, Valencia. The complete list is available on the website www.best.eu.org/courses/list.jsp.
