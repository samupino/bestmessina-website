# Our identity
BEST, Board of European Students of Technology, is a constantly growing non-profit and non-political organization. Since 1989 we provide communication, co-operation and exchange possibilities for students all over Europe.

## About us
BEST helps students coming from universities of technology all over Europe and push them to be more open-minded and international, in order to get a better understanding of different cultures and the ability of working together, even in such a big contest. Through events – both academical and not – BEST makes plenty of opportunities for students to meet and learn from each other, sharing their knowledge and ideas. Our association also offers exclusive services such as the international center for career, that helps students when they enter the job world.

## Community
Our priority is to offer high quality services for students from Europe and to build links between the three stakeholders of the triangle always stronger: “Students, Companies and Universities”. If you’d like to discover more, check the official website www.best.eu.org .
