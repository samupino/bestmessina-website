Where to start?

- Before applying to any event, we advise you to read the information on the web page very carefully. What and how will the event be? What kind of attendees are the organizers looking for? etc‚Ä¶ Reading the Survival Guide can be very helpful in this regard!
- Each local BEST Group can receive something like four hundred letters to their course! Can you imagine reading all those different Motivation Letters? If you want your letter to stand out, then, try to be creative and fun and to capture the attention of your reader.
- The letter must be written in English.
You can find information on the various events on the page https://www.best.eu.org/courses/list.jsp

## What to write
- Take the time to write it with commitment and imagination! Why do you want to participate in a BEST event? And why exactly at that event ?! You will also be able to view and retouch it after sending it. You are not applying for the CNR, always remember that those who will read and judge the letter will be guys like you, or maybe even younger: explain your professional interests then, but take at least as much space to talk about yourself and your hobbies. .. Do not write a poem, but not even two lines ‚Ä¶ one page will do. Another tip is to refer to the topic of the course, in which you are very interested (abroad they look a lot at your interest not only ‚Äúgoliardic‚Äù but also ‚Äúacademic‚Äù) üôÇ
- Introduce yourself. Start by writing something about yourself: what you study, what you do in life, what are your hobbies, what sports do you do, maybe even what languages you know ‚Ä¶ BEST Courses are always full of fun, so it is useful for the organizers to know that you you are a fun and friendly person.
- Interest in the course. Why do you want to go abroad? And why do you want to go to that BEST event? Remember, it‚Äôs important for organizers to have people with an international mindset. Why do you want to go to this particular course you are applying for? Why is the topic attractive to you? How will knowledge of that course help you (in your course of study, in your future career‚Ä¶)? BEST courses, for example, have a strong academic part (depending on the level of the course), so it is important for the organizers to know if you are really interested in the topic! Remember that you are not applying for the CNR; who will read and judge the letter will be boys like you, or maybe even younger.
- Interest in the city where the course is held. Explain why you want to go to that city or country! It is strongly recommended that you do a little research of the location where the course will be held and that you are applying for before writing your motivation letters. Look for famous monuments, typical food and drink, traditions, etc‚Ä¶ Organizers like it when candidates show real interest in their city.
- What do you have more than others. What do you have to offer at the event? In other words, why should organizers take you? (eg: you are a karaoke star, you dance like Michael Jackson, or you know more than 100 jokes etc‚Ä¶).
## What to avoid
- Your Motivation Letter will be read by students, just like you. Therefore, there is no need to use formal forms such as ‚ÄúDear Madam or Sir‚Äù!
- A motivation letter is NOT a curriculum vitae (CV). Don‚Äôt bother writing down all the schools you‚Äôve attended, grades, jobs you‚Äôve done‚Ä¶ They want to know something about you and how you are!
It is not allowed to insert images or links in your motivation letter.
- Be careful to send the appropriate letter to the appropriate place.
- Copying / pasting a motivation letter is not highly recommended. You should try to make each cover letter personal and unique!
- Don‚Äôt write a poem, but not two lines! Half a page (or one page) of A4 paper is already enough, and should be enough for the organizers to get to know you. If the letter is longer than one and a half / two pages of A4, there is the possibility that they will not read everything. On the other hand, if it is too short, they will think that you are not interested enough in the event! So try to find the right balance.
- Avoid submitting questions at the last minute, to avoid site crashes (as the deadline approaches, servers may be overloaded due to the high flow of inputs).
## Other advices
- Divide your motivation letter into paragraphs: be clear, but above all try not to be trivial, and put your heart into it!
- Personal Data: in your BEST account there is a part called ‚ÄúPersonal Data‚Äù: your studies, hobbies, knowledge of languages‚Ä¶ Try to fill it in as much as possible!
- Time factor: the sooner you submit the application, the sooner the organizers can start reading it. So don‚Äôt shrink at the last moment to do it.
- Send us your Motivation Letters for advice or to fix some English mistakes. We will be happy to help you, but do it in time, avoiding reducing yourself to the last, because so many other guys like you will do it and we could be overworked. You can send them to messina@BEST-eu.org.
