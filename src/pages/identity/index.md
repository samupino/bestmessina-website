# About us

BEST helps students coming from universities of technology all over Europe and push them to be more open-minded and international, in order to get a better understanding of different cultures and the ability of working together, even in such a big contest. Through events – both academical and not – BEST makes plenty of opportunities for students to meet and learn from each other, sharing their knowledge and ideas. Our association also offers exclusive services such as the international center for career, that helps students when they enter the job world.
