# What we offer

Through BEST, companies can reach dynamic, innovative and international open-minded students of well known technical universities in Europe.

The specific ways of collaboration will be discussed with each company
individually.
Below you can find some examples of possible cooperation, but we are always open to hear your proposals:

### Case Study / Training

Training events are meant to enhance personal and professional development for students.
By giving a professional training/case study to future engineers, you will have the opportunity to do a sophisticated and targeted recruitment process through seeing students solve the tasks you prepared for the competition.

### Promotional events

BEST Messina aims to be a bridge between students and companies looking for dynamic and motivated young STEM Students.
We offer the opportunity to become widely known in the opinion of both local and European students through all media materials where the company will be presented as our partner (website, articles, brochure, printed materialâ€¦)

### Communication Opportunities

Partners of BEST Messina are invited to address a speech or make a formal presentation of the company during our events.
This is an excellent opportunity for companies to promote job offers, internships and graduate programmes.
Get in touch with the next generation of STEM Students!

### Internal communication

All over the year you will have benefit of our presence in the university to reach local students trough formal presentation, workshops, round table or any kind of meetings you wish.
