# What we offer

Through BEST, companies can reach dynamic, innovative and international open-minded students of well known technical universities in Europe.

The specific ways of collaboration will be discussed with each company
individually.
Below you can find some examples of possible cooperation, but we are always open to hear your proposals:

## Case Study / Training

Training events are meant to enhance personal and professional development for students.
By giving a professional training/case study to future engineers, you will have the opportunity to do a sophisticated and targeted recruitment process through seeing students solve tasks they had especifically prepared for the competition.

## Promotional events

BEST Messina aims to be a bridge between students and companies looking for dynamic and motivated young engineers. We offer the opportunity to become
widely known in the opinion of both local and European engineering students through all media materials where the company will be presented as our partner (website, articles, brochure, printed materialâ€¦)

## Communication Opportunities

Partners of BEST Messina are invited to address a speech or make a formal presentation of the company during our events.
This is an excellent opportunity for companies to make themselves known among engineering students coming from best technical universities in Europe.

## Internal communication

All over the year you will have benefit of our presence in the university to reach local students trough formal presentation, workshops, round table or any kind of meetings you wish.

Partnerships and sponsorships help us in the organization of our activities, but our goal is that our partners benefit too from the partnership, so we offer different opportunities and <p style={{color: 'blue'}}> services tailored to the needs of each company : </p>

Development comes together with innovation and that's why we will always encourage and support innovative ideas.

Promote job offers, internships and graduate programmes.
Get in touch with the next generation of engineers and scientists.
